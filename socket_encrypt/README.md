The server.py and client.py scripts are used to establish a connection over a socket using the sockets module. A message goes through symmetric encryption using 
the Fernet module and it is then sent over to the client. 

Potential improvements:  
Allow bidirectional communication  
Pass entires files over the socket  
Prompt for user input to pass as a message or to provide filepath of file to be transferred
